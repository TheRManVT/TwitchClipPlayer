# 🎬 Twitch Clips Downloader + OBS HTML Player

This project automates the process of collecting top Twitch clips from a specific channel and serves them through a randomized HTML video player—perfect for embedding in OBS via a browser source.

The player runs on an external server and updates automatically after each stream ends using Twitch's EventSub webhook system.

---

## 🔧 Features

* ✅ Automatically downloads top Twitch clips when a stream ends.
* ✅ HTML video player plays clips randomly on loop.
* ✅ Fully containerized using Docker and docker-compose.
* ✅ Webhook integration via Twitch EventSub.
* ✅ Hosted externally and accessible behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx Proxy Manager).
* ✅ Works seamlessly with OBS as a browser source.

---

## ⚠️ Before You Begin

### ✅ You MUST manually download all existing clips first!

Place them in the `clips_downloader/downloaded_clips/` folder using `twitch-dl` or other tools, e.g.:

```bash
twitch-dl clips your_channel_name --download --limit 100 --target-dir clips_downloader/downloaded_clips
```

This is necessary because the script is designed to only fetch *new clips after the stream ends*. Existing clips **won’t** be re-downloaded unless removed.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository and prepare clips

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/twitch_clips_downloader.git
cd twitch_clips_downloader
```

Download your existing clips using `twitch-dl` (or similar), and place them in `clips_downloader/downloaded_clips/`.

### 2. Fill out the `.env` file

Edit the `.env-example` file and save it as `.env`

```dotenv
CHANNEL_NAME=your_twitch_channel_here
MAX_CLIPS=10
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_client_id
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitch_client_secret
TWITCH_EVENTSUB_SECRET=a_random_secure_secret
TWITCH_USER_ID=your_channel_user_id
WEBHOOK_CALLBACK_URL=https://your.public.domain/webhook
```

> Use tools like [Twitch Token Generator](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/) to get your client credentials and User ID.

### 3. Configure Reverse Proxy

This project assumes you're using **Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)**. Make sure:

* Port `5404` is exposed on your server (can be changed, if you want).
* Your proxy forwards `https://your.public.domain` → `http://localhost:5404`.

---

### 4. Build and Run

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will:

* Start the webhook server (`webhook_server.py`) listening on port `5405`.
* Start an Nginx container serving the HTML player and clip files on port `5404`.

---

## 🧪 Test It

* Open `https://your.public.domain` — you should see the HTML player start playing clips randomly.
* You can also open it inside OBS via the **Browser Source** using the same public URL.

---

## 🔁 What Happens After a Stream Ends?

Once the Twitch channel goes offline:

1. Twitch sends an EventSub notification.
2. The webhook server triggers `main.sh`.
3. It downloads the latest top clips (if new ones are available).
4. Regenerates the HTML file (`generated_index.html`) with the new list of clips.

---

## 📌 Notes

* OBS will show player controls by default. You can remove them by editing `main.sh` if desired.
* The HTML auto-refreshes every 30 minutes to load new clips.
* The script avoids re-downloading clips that are already present in `downloaded_clips/`.

---

## 🧹 Clean Up Docker Context (optional)

To avoid Docker copying all `.mp4` files during the build process, the `.dockerignore` excludes them.

If needed, clean Docker's build cache:

```bash
docker builder prune
```
